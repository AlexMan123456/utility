# v3.10.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- We are now officially using the release tooling from `alex-c-line`!
- Nothing substantial in this package has changed with this release - I just wanted to test that the command works here as well.

## Additional Notes

- See https://github.com/AlexMan123456/alex-c-line/blob/main/docs/releases/minor/v1.8.0.md for more information on the release tooling I am talking about.
