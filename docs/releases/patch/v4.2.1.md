# v4.2.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Fixes the `VersionNumber` implementation so that `nonNegativeTupleError` (renamed to `NON_NEGATIVE_TUPLE_ERROR`) does not leak out when doing `console.log(new VersionNumber(version))`.
- Turns out the `private` keyword isn't fully private and only enforces privacy at compile-time. As such, any private attributes on a class can still show in logs, even if marked as `private`.
- The fix in this case was to make that property a private static property, so that it doesn't show up on instances of `VersionNumber` and is also only accessible as a static property on `VersionNumber` inside the class itself.

## Additional Notes

- Lesson learned: class accessibility modifiers in TypeScript are actually compile-time only. They do not affect the runtime.
