# v4.3.5 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a JSDoc comment for the `ItemType` type argument in `fillArray`
    - This was missing previously so the docs site only showed that this was a type argument without explaining its purpose.

## Additional Notes

- JSDoc comments should explain the purpose of all function arguments as that's the thing that will help guide users the most.
