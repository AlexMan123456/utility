# v4.5.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Export `encryptWithKey` function mentioned in [release note v4.5.0](https://github.com/alextheman231/utility/releases/tag/v4.5.0)

## Additional Notes

- I keep forgetting to do this step...
- Interesting thing is, the `v4.5.0` version change did get merged in when I realised this and I thought I could potentially save it by stopping the publish action before it got to the publish step, but I don't think I made it on time, hence the need to create this release note.
- Would've been such an epic moment if I could save `v4.5.0` by doing that, though! Almost like a scene from a developer movie or something, where they save a bad build from making it into production, and we cue the epic cinematic music or something like that.
- Speaking of, I would pay to watch a developer movie like that. That would be peak cinema right there. Anyone who has any recommendations, feel free to make a pull request to add a few under this bullet point (or just comment on the pull request associated with this release note. That's fine too!).
