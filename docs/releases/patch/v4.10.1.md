# v4.10.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Fix `=` potentially breaking `{ quoteStyle: "none" }` in `stringifyDotenv`.
- Fix literal `\` characters breaking `stringifyDotenv` as well.
    - In both cases, the function now throws an error in the case where `quoteStyle` is `"none"` and the value contains either of the above characters.

## Additional Notes

- Seriously, why doesn't the `dotenv` package already have a native stringify command?
- If it has parse and knows how to do the logic already, why not just do it in reverse and give us stringify as well?
