# v4.3.4 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a `[Symbol.toPrimitive]` method to the `VersionNumber` class.
    - This is helpful to ensure that if a coercion to string is attempted with a `VersionNumber` (by means of string concatenation, template string interpolation etc.), it always definitely calls the `.toString()` method and therefore always returns a version number string with the version prefixed with `v`.
    - It will also throw a `DataError` if you try coercing it to a number, because version numbers don't really work like that.
- Adds a `.toJSON()` method to the `VersionNumber` class.
    - The motivation is the same as the above, but for if it gets included in a `JSON.stringify()`. That's helpful in cases where you may want to send a `VersionNumber` through as part of an API response, for example.
- Fixes the `.increment()` JSDoc comment.
    - It was previously trying to describe the `.type` property. This has now been changed to actually document the `.increment()` method.

## Additional Notes

- If only I could lint JSDoc content so that I can verify the actual description matches the function, but I suppose it's too much to expect linters to guess human intent from the function summaries, isn't it?
