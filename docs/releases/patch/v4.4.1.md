# v4.4.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Quick version change to test the publish workflow
    - I have changed it so that we only tag and create a GitHub release on successful publish to NPM.
    - This will ensure that we don't end up accidentally creating a GitHub release for a version of the package that does not exist on NPM.
