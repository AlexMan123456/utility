# v4.3.3 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Exports the `getInterpolations` function
    - I thought it was being exported this entire time, until it didn't get automatically included in the generated docs! Now I know why it didn't.
- So... you use it to get the strings and interpolations from a given template string. For example, getInterpolations`Test ${"hello"} ${123}` will give `["Test", ["hello", 123]]`.
- It's useful for setting up tests for tagged template functions where you may want to test what happens when you pass the strings and interpolations into the function directly rather than passing the tagged template string (or at least, it will be now that it's actually exported!)

## Additional Notes

- Lesson learned - export your utility functions!
- Or rather, good thing we now have a way to actually track what's being exported based on what gets included in the feature docs, I suppose...
