# v4.10.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a `removeUndefinedFromObject` helper to remove undefined entries from an object
    - This follows from a bug in `alex-c-line` where the `create-pull-request-template` command was throwing an error because we were passing undefined as values as part of the object in the options parser, but due to the discriminated union type that is not valid.
    - As such, what we need to do instead is filter out any undefined values from the object, then pass it to the parser, hence the creation of this function.

## Additional Notes

- The erroring part in `alex-c-line` can be found [here](https://github.com/alextheman231/alex-c-line/blob/e564ce5bcb19291b98eeb4de92eda9b9522d0328/src/commands/create-pull-request-template-2.ts#L77)
