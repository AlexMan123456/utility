# v4.4.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Allows the third argument of `parseZodSchema` to take either an instance of `Error`, or a function that returns an instance of `Error`.
    - The benefit of allowing a function that returns the error is so that we can give it access to the Zod error itself in case it needs it to display more specific information in the error message (e.g. if you need any access to unrecognised object keys so you can display it in the error message).
- Change the default error thrown by `parseZodSchema` to use the default Zod code and Zod message for the `DataError` code and message.
    - Previously I wasn't passing in any code or error to the default thrown error here, but now we take the first of the Zod issues and surface that as the code and message by default.
