# v4.5.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds an `encryptWithKey` function to encrypt a string given a base64 public key.
    - The logic already exists in `alex-c-line` but has been moved over here so it can also be used more natively in TypeScript code if needed without needing to invoke execa or execSync and parse stdout.
    - See [alex-c-line release note v1.17.0](https://github.com/alextheman231/alex-c-line/releases/tag/v1.17.0) for more information about `encrypt-with-key`.
