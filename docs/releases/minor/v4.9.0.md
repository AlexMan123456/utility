# v4.9.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds `parseZodSchemaAsync` to allow for asynchronous schema parsing.
    - The alex-c-line pre-commit-2 config is expected to allow for a function to be passed as a step, which would also pass in the command runner to allow users to run other commands as part of the pre-commits, but that requires that we have something that allows us to parse asynchronous Zod schemas, hence the reason this change has been added.

## Additional Notes

- I have not added tests for this function because it uses pretty much the same logic as the synchronous version which is tested, and I don't know if there's really any async-specific behaviour worth testing as of now.
