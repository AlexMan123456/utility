# v4.8.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Improves the default error returned from `parseZodSchema`
    - The default error code is now a comma-separated string list of error codes, grouped by frequency (e.g. `INVALID_TYPE×2,UNRECOGNIZED_KEYS×1`).
    - The default error message is now provided from `z.prettifyError()` for better readability.

## Additional Notes

- If you were previously strictly asserting against the error code, this may break your existing implementations (hence why this is a minor release and not a patch).
    - To fix any potential breakage, please use `error.code.includes("ERROR_CODE")` when asserting against the error code, as there is now a chance it may be included alongside other error codes.
- Implementations will also break if you were asserting against the error message, but if that happens, that's on you!
    - The error message is not really something we should ever be asserting against as it's meant more for logs/human-readability than it is for machines.
- As such, please only ever assert against the error code if you want to narrow down the type of error provided from `DataError`, and only use the error message to guide you on how to fix it (or log it if you intended to throw an error).
