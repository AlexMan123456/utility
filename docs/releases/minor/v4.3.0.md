# v4.3.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a static `.isEqual()` method to `VersionNumber`.
    - This checks if two different instances of `VersionNumber` have the same major, minor, and patch numbers.
    - It's a static method, so you call it like `VersionNumber.isEqual(firstVersion, secondVersion)`.
- Changes the `NON_POSITIVE_INPUTS` error code to `NEGATIVE_INPUTS`.
    - Just be aware of this if you're currently asserting against DataError codes.

## Additional Notes

- I decided to make `VersionNumber.isEqual()` static because of the symmetrical nature of the operation.
- A lot of other classes may expose a `.equals()` method on the instance (i.e. `firstVersion.equals(secondVersion)`), but I'm not as big a fan of that because it implies that there's something particularly special about `firstVersion` that means it gets to be in charge of the operation, even though the operation should be commutative.
- On the other hand, `VersionNumber.isEqual(firstNumber, secondNumber)`, while technically taking two arguments in a specific order, still makes it feel less attached semantically, and at least feels more like we're trying to treat the two equally.
