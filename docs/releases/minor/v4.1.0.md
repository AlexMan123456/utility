# v4.1.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds an additional option to `camelToKebab` that allows you to disable the preservation of capital groupings. 
    - For example, `validateAPIUser` will become
        - `validate-api-user` if called with no options or `preserveConsecutiveCapitals` set to true
        - `validate-a-p-i-user` if `preserveConsecutiveCapitals` is set to false.
    - Example:

    ```typescript
    camelToKebab("validateAPIUser") // "validate-api-user"
    camelToKebab("validateAPIUser", { preserveConsecutiveCapitals: true }) // "validate-api-user"
    camelToKebab("validateAPIUser", { preserveConsecutiveCapitals: false }) // "validate-a-p-i-user"
    ```

## Additional Notes
- This aligns better with the `CamelToKebab` type in ESLint plugin, as that doesn't support capital group preservation. I also don't really want to make it do so either as it's a lot harder to do at the type level.
- In doing this, I have more confidence in the fact that because the ESLint plugin type can now match the runtime, users will not get misled by the type system when they try using the new generic `createConfigGroup` and `flattenConfigs` helpers that will come out in v5 of that plugin.
