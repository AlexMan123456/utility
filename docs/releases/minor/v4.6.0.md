# v4.6.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Add a `stringifyDotenv` function.
    - This converts a JavaScript object into a string that can be part of a `.env` file.

## Additional Notes

- I am honestly surprised this isn't already covered in other packages.
- The dotenv package itself not having this feels like a massive oversight - why **wouldn't** it have this?
- As such, I decided to take matters into my own hands and fight all the character escaping logic for you all so you don't have to. You're welcome.
- For me, I'll be using this in `alex-c-line`'s new `edit-env-file` command, which will allow us to edit `.env` files from the command-line. This will be better than manually editing them as it'll prevent accidental secret leakage when screen sharing as we can hide secrets from the command-line.
