# v3.9.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Exports the `ParseVersionOptions` type so you can type the options for that function separately.
- Adds an `incrementVersion` function that can be used to calculate the increment for a given version number.
- Adds a `CreateEnumType` type that extracts a union of values from a const object, as an alternative to TypeScript enums.

## Additional Notes

- `incrementVersion` is expected to be used in AlexCLine to generate the release docs so it can create the docs without needing to do `npm version`, as that will change `package.json`, which goes against this new release pattern of only committing substantial features in a pull request manually, then running a workflow to automatically change the version in `package.json`.
- The `CreateEnumType` is neat and may get usage in Neurosongs 2 at some point, or maybe even my components library to replace the manual type creation of `FileType` there.
