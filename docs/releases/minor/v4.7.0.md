# v4.7.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Fixes the schema types in `parseZodSchema` so that it's less tied to the Zod internals.
    - The previous way where we were passing in the input, output, and internals separately was causing a type error when we tried passing in a discriminated union. This change fixes that so that we don't have that type error anymore.
- Allow the error function to have a void return or throw an error.
    - This is useful in cases where we may not necessarily want to throw our own error, but we do want to do some sort of logic (e.g. logging to console) before the default error gets thrown.
