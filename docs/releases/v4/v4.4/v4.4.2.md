# v4.4.2 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Move this repository to my new GitHub organisation
    - This release is here to test that the NPM publish still works. I had to change the trusted publishing path so that it points to the publish workflow in this repository rather than my now non-existent personal one.
